# Snolf Mania
*At last.*


# Playing
* Use the **RSDKv5U** decomp with Sonic Mania. 

# Building
* Check out the repository with git: `git clone --recursive git@github.com:DrMelon/SnolfMania.git`  
* Navigate into the directory: `cd SnolfMania`
* **Linux/MacOS**: `cmake .`, then `cmake --build .`
* **Windows**: Install vscode, and the CMake Tools extension from Microsoft. Open the folder in vscode, and when prompted to configure with CMake in vscode, select "Yes". Build release using the CMake Tools extension for Win x64. Note: I have only tested this with LLVM/Clang (16.0.5 x86_64-pc-windows-msvc) so far on Windows.
* **Other Platforms**: You probably know better than I do - and it's likely going to involve running cmake with your preferred target configuration.

# Credits & Special Thanks
* Using Rubberduckycooly's GameAPI, Sonic Mania Decompilation, & RSDKv5 Decompilation. 
* Some configuration files based on MegAmi24's mods.
